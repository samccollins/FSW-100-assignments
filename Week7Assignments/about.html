                        <span>Owners Brandon and Kayleigh are both from Upstate New York and have</span>
                        <span>been apart of the Cape Coral Community since 2015. They are no</span>
                        <span>strangers to hard work, and with determination opened a total of 7,200</span>
                        <span>sq. ft. of fun for your dogs! Offering services in Boarding, Daycare, and</span>
                        <span>Grooming.</span>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span>Kayleigh has been a Veterinary Technician for 9 years, and a Professional</span>
                        <span>Pet sitter for 8 years. In Kayleighâ€™s years of working as a Technician, it</span>
                        <span>trained her to offer unlimited care within her Pet Sitting business. Her</span>
                        <span>dream job would be to open her own pet resort. This would include a fun,</span>
                        <span>safe environment for dogs to come play, interact, but also cater to all</span>
                        <span>personalities and needs that she has seen come through a veterinary</span>
                        <span>setting that require a little more patience and TLC.</span>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span>Brandon comes from a business background where he assisted in</span>
                        <span>managing and operating his long running family business for 30 years,</span>
                        <span>Thunder Island; an entertainment facility consisting of a water park,</span>
                        <span>amusement rides, indoor banquets and events. Brandon grew up learning</span>
                        <span>to design, build, open and operate, various levels of the business from his</span>
                        <span>father and mother, and would later become an integral part of that</span>
                        <span>business. Being the 4th generation of entrepreneurs, it was only natural</span>
                        <span>for Brandon to venture into unfamiliar territory.</span>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span>This well experienced partnership would evolve to create a business that</span>
                        <span>they both could enjoy doing. The man who would carry on family</span>
                        <span>tradition, and a woman with a dream and pet industry experience.</span>
